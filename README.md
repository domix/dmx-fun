# Functional Programming Constructions in Java

This repository contains a collection of implementations and experiments exploring **functional programming constructions in Java**. The goal is to demonstrate how functional paradigms‚Äîsuch as immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions, currying, and more‚Äîcan be expressed in Java, a traditionally object-oriented language.

## üîç Purpose

While Java is not a purely functional language, modern features like lambda expressions, streams, and the `Optional` and `CompletableFuture` APIs allow for elegant and expressive functional-style programming. This project aims to:

- Explore functional programming principles in Java
- Showcase reusable constructions inspired by functional languages
- Experiment with Java libraries that support functional programming
- Serve as a reference and learning resource for developers

## üì¶ What's Included

Examples and implementations may include:

- Function composition and higher-order functions  
- Currying and partial application  
- Immutable data structures  
- Functional error handling (e.g., using `Try`, `Either`, or `Option`)  
- Lazy evaluation  
- Monads and functors (in a Java-friendly context)  
- Functional streams and pipelines  

## üõ† Technologies

- Java 24+  
- Gradle
- Spock for testing  
- [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io/) or similar libraries for functional data types (optional)
